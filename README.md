The API Gateway is responsible for request routing, composition, and protocol translation. All requests from clients first go through the API Gateway.

|[CI](https://github.com/AdyKalra/technolgytrends/blob/master/EngineeringPractices%20trends/Orchestrating%20CI%20CD%20Pipelines.md)|Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.Continuous Integration doesn‚Äôt get rid of bugs, but it does make them dramatically easier to find and remove.|‚≠ê|
|[Coordinating pull requests and code reviews in Slack](https://github.com/AdyKalra/technolgytrends/blob/master/EngineeringPractices%20trends/Coordinating%20pull%20requests%20and%20code%20reviews%20in%20Slack.md)|Modern software development often requires large teams of people interacting over a single codebase, using code tracking systems that can manage incoming and outgoing changes while avoiding conflicts. While every engineering team might use a different service to manage their code, they can all use Slack as the central place for testing and review.Using a combination of channels, threads and apps, engineering teams can save a lot of time by not needing to wade through email inboxes and app alerts, or jump between browser tabs. And that means their code gets into customers‚Äô hands that much faster.|‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê|
|[Code Deployment best practices from Slack](https://github.com/AdyKalra/technolgytrends/blob/master/EngineeringPractices%20trends/Code%20Deployment%20best%20practices.md)|At Slack, we value quick iteration, fast feedback loops, and responsiveness to customer feedback. We also have hundreds of engineers who are trying to be as productive as possible. Keeping to these values while growing as a company means continual refinement of our deployment system.

Their success, however, is measured by a more precise metric: how quickly they can get what they build into their customers‚Äô hands.Slack is a powerful addition to the toolchain of apps required to properly test, document and deploy code. It acts as a discussion space to foster collaboration and help support the efforts of engineering teams but also as a centralized, long-term record of what‚Äôs taken place, which includes most of the other apps your team may use.Here at Slack, we deploy dozens of code changes to production servers multiple times a day.

Instead of creating a potentially unbounded number of monitoring metrics, we suggest using a small number of alerts grounded in customer pain‚Äîi.e., violation of SLOs.
